# Firebase Practices

This is a online space where I will archives my practicals on Google Cloud Firebase. This include study notes (in comments) and reference links when I troubleshoot.



Most of my projects are from online tutorials and individual credits will be indicated in coding page and/or read.me file.

Have fun coding!

Shirley

P/s: Thank you to my boss at Utrix Pte Ltd for this opportunity!
